<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
  <li>3 pounds (about 5 medium) sweet onions, sliced</li>
  <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
  <li>1/3 cup dry white wine</li>
  <li>6 cups beef stock
  <li>4 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
  <li>2 bay leaves</li>
  <li>2 teaspoons white wine vinegar</li>
  <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
  <li>12 (3/4-inch-thick) French baguette slices</li>
  <li>1 cup shredded Swiss cheese</li>
  <li>1 cup shredded Gruy√®re cheese</li>
  </ul>

  <ol>
    <li>Melt butter in a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onions, and cook, stirring often, until deep golden brown and caramelized, about 30-40 minutes.* Stir in garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Stir in wine, scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the stockpot.</li>
    <li>Stir in beef stock, thyme and bay leaves. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until slightly reduced, about 15-20 minutes. Remove and discard thyme sprigs and bay leaves.</li>
    <li>Stir in white wine vinegar; season with salt and pepper, to taste.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to broil.</li>
    <li>Place baguette slices onto a baking sheet. Place into oven and broil until golden brown on both sides, about 1-2 minutes per side; set aside.</li>
    <li>Divide soup into ramekins or ovenproof bowls. Place onto a baking sheet. Top with baguette slices to cover the surface of the soup completely; sprinkle with cheeses. Place into oven and broil until golden brown and cheeses have melted; about 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Serve immediately.</li>
  </ol>
